                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
                    To the modern mind, the Old Testament system of animal sacrifice can seem primitive. However, it was a precise legal demonstration of the <strong>Cost of Sin</strong>. God was teaching humanity a fundamental spiritual law: Sin is a debt that can only be settled by life.

                            <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                                Under the Old Covenant, sacrifice was a constant, grueling routine. The Jews offered animals daily, seasonally, and on their own accord for personal sins. Because animal blood could only <strong>cover</strong> sin but never <strong>remove</strong> it, the ritual had to be repeated indefinitely. It was a temporary placeholder that served as a constant reminder of guilt.

                            <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                                In a sacrifice, the sinner would place their hands on the head of a spotless lamb. This act symbolized the <strong>transfer of guilt</strong>. The innocent creature died not for its own faults, but as a substitute for the person. It was an "eye for an eye" in the spiritual realm—a life for a life.

                        <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-4">The routine of sacrifice was designed to make the world crave a permanent solution. That solution was Christ.</p>

                            <li class="flex gap-2"><span>🐑</span> <span><strong>The Shadow:</strong> Animal sacrifice was a recurring "tutor" that proved man could never pay his own debt.</span></li>
                            <li class="flex gap-2"><span>✝️</span> <span><strong>The Reality:</strong> Jesus became the "Lamb of God." Because He was sinless and eternal, His death was of infinite value.</span></li>

                <p class="text-gray-600 mb-10">Science is the process of "thinking God's thoughts after Him." Far from being enemies, the Bible and true science are two books written by the same Author. One reveals His works; the other reveals His words.</p>

This "Anthropic Principle" points to a Designer who carefully prepared a home for His children.</p>
