# The Finished Work
An open-source, digital take on a traditional gospel tract.

The Finished Work is a modern reimagining of the gospel tract. While traditional tracts are physical paper pamphlets used to share spiritual messages, this project brings that concept into the digital age as a responsive, accessible, and open-source web experience.

This project is currently a **work in progress**. While the initial publish is in a fully working and readable state, some internal code formatting may appear unconventional and certain elements are still being optimized. The primary goal is to provide a clear, beautifully designed presentation of the gospel message that can be easily shared via a link, hosted anywhere, and kept for personal use.

## Live Project
The live project is hosted by GitHub via the GitHub Pages platform at: [TheFinishedWork.org](https://thefinishedwork.org/)

## Features
- **Open Source:** This project is published under the MIT license. Feel free to fork and adapt it for your own needs.
- **Minimal Dependencies:** The project utilizes a central Tailwind CSS file for core layout and formatting. However, all unique styling and content are handled within the individual HTML files. No external JavaScript libraries, frameworks, or third-party tracking assets are required.
- **Platform Agnostic:** Optimized for mobile and desktop reading with a focus on typography and clarity.
- **Lightweight:** Built with performance in mind for instant loading.

## Portability & Offline Use
One of the core principles of this project is accessibility. While the online version pulls a shared Tailwind CSS backend for global formatting, the files are structured to be resilient:
- **Self-Contained Logic:** You can download these files directly to your computer or phone. 
- **Local Access:** They can be opened locally in any web browser. Even without the external CSS file, the files remain functional and readable. 
- **No Bloat:** By avoiding other external JavaScript libraries or complex scripts, the project ensures long-term compatibility while also respecting user privacy.

## Usage
You are welcome to share the [TheFinishedWork.org](https://thefinishedwork.org/) link to spread the message with others, fork the repository to create your own version with unique styling or content, or archive the files locally to ensure you always have access to the content on your own devices.
